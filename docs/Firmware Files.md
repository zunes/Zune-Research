# Firmware Files
The following Information was taken from [xda-developers](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/the-b000ff-bin-format-detailed.801167/) forum:

The Zune uses the ``B000FF`` file format for its firmware. It is used by Windows CE devices to write to flash memory. It saves space by skipping empty areas.

There is a tutorial on how to use the tools [[Firmware Files#Dumping Tutorial|at the bottom]].

## File Format
### Header
```cpp
struct BIN_HEADER {
char[7] Signature;      // B000FF\n signature	
DWORD ImageStart;    // Image Start
DWORD ImageLength; // Image Length
};
```

### Binary Block
```cpp
struct BIN_BLOCK {
DWORD Address; // Address where the block should be flashed
DWORD Size; // Size of the block that is being flashed
DWORD Checksum; // Checksum (CRC32) of the block data
};
```

[[TODO]]: Rewrite the text bellow:

### How it works
The file starts with the header structure, followed by N number of block structures each one followed by the respective data of the block. A block with Address / Size / Checksum set to 0 is a termination block and marks the end of the file. 

Note that some blocks can be missing and depending on the bootloader the region could be left untouched or erased (erased bytes could have any value, it depends on the type of memory (NAND erased bytes have FF value) and on the bootloader).  
  
#### How to check the integrity of a B000FF file
Read the header, read the first block and check that its address equals ``ImageStart``, check that the termination block is present and check that the last block before the termination block address equals the sum of ``ImageStart + ImageLength``.  
  
#### How to convert a B000FF file to an [absolute binary format file (NB0)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa448347.aspx) 
Allocate an empty file with the size of ``ImageLength`` and write each of the blocks' data inside at the absolute file position of ``Block Address - ImageStart``.  
  
The missing blocks are usually empty areas (or at least that's what are in the files generated by Microsoft tools) that could be ignored by the bootloader or erased (with the bytes values depending on the memory type and on the bootloader code) but in case you encounter them make sure you investigate what those missing belong to, it could be a fancy way for the manufacturer to leave some areas reserved for the phone or bootloader and should be left untouched when re-creating the file.  
  
#### Current tools available to work with BIN files
-   CVRTBIN/VIEWBIN to convert the file to a "ROM" file (ABX/NB0/ROM memory image, call it how you want)
-   OSNBTOOL (suggested, because it lets you figure out what is in the file) that can do the following operating:
    -   split (-sp): finds the OS.NB inside the BIN and saves the OS.NB and the unrecognized data that comes before and after it
    -   generate BIN (-2bin): converts a file to the BIN format and has two important switches, one to set the start address of the data and one to tell it to not write the header (so that you can example append other BIN data in front of it)
    -   fix BIN header (-fixbinheader) scans the BIN file and adjusts the imagestart and imagelength according to the content

## Dumping Tutorial
1. Get the **start** and the **length** of the Image 
	``$ viewbin.exe nk.bin``

	```shell
	ViewBin... NK.bin
	Image Start = 0x00014000, length = 0x00B7A4E4
                Start address = 0x00023F10
	```
	Note down the **Image Start** and the **length**

2. Convert the .bin file to a absolute .nb0 file
	``$ cvrtbin -r -a IMAGE_START -w 32 -l LENGTH nk.bin``
	Replace ``IMAGE_START`` and ``LENGTH`` with the values from the last step.

3. Finnaly dump the contents of the rom
	``$ dumprom.exe -d dump -v -5 nk.nb0``
	‚ö†Ô∏è The folder specifies with ``-d`` must exist before executing the command. 

These steps can be repeated with the other files as well.
