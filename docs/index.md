Welcome,
my name is Lars and this is my digital garden about the [[Zune HD|Zune]]!

Here I will be sharing all the information I find about the Zune. I will mostly talk about its hardware / firmware and how to develop applications for it more than 20 years after it was first published. Most of the information will revolve around the **[[Zune HD]]** as it has the best hardware and is less secure than the older models. 

For a guide on how to install the OpenZDK click [[OpenZDK Setup|here]].

Files marked with 🗺️ (World Map Emoji) are overview notes and link you to all the subtopics in that topic.
